Assessment Task
Barkers Clothing have been the store of choice for New Zealand men for decades (since 1972 actually) outfitting them for daily life, unforgettable milestones, and everything in between. We’re pretty chuffed to have been doing this so long, and we still prioritise the good stuff like quality, understated style. and true value as much as the day we started.
You can find their stores nationwide, everywhere from Newmarket to New Plymouth. All of them boast their carefully considered range of quality apparel, footwear and accessories - everything customers need, nothing they don’t.
Barkers is there for their first job, that ultimate promotion, their big day, and their morning after. Customers can come to Barkers for everything from that handsome winter coat (the best way to look respectable) to those track pants they wear every Sunday. Barkers have new gear and old favourites dropping regularly, so customers stop by and see them at any of their stores nationwide, or shop online without even leaving the couch.
Prior to 2020 ,the company was thriving, but the combined pressures of Covid19, the ever increasing pressures on the retail sector, and the growth of offshore online shopping, Barkers feels the need to reorient what they do to survive and grow in the future.
Whilst they have a well developed online shopping offering, they need an innovative, low cost and low risk marketing plan to move the company ionto the future.
